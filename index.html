        <h2>why do we exist?</h2>
        <p>We exist to help you extract value from your data..</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>what story is your data telling?</h2>

            <p class="resp1">Storytelling is an incredibly powerful tool because it is how humans make sense of the world.  Stories are an effective way to not only communicate information but also meaning.  However, today’s challenge is the vast amount of information or data available.</p>
        </div>

            <p class="resp1">The exponential growth in data is astounding:</p>
            <ul class="list1">
                <li>Approx 44 trillion gigabytes of data by 2020</li>
                <li>1 trillion photos were taken in 2015</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="resp2">The question is, how your business will use this data to create meaningful stories?</p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <h2>why use a visualisation tool like canvas</h2>
        <p>It is estimated that for a typical Fortune 1000 company, a mere 10% increase in data accessibility will result in more than $65 million additional net income.  But just 0.5% of all data is currently being analysed.</p>
        <p>Typical barriers to analysis are access to the right data and a dynamic, integrated tool that is easy to understand and easy to use.</p>
        <p>Visual stories help us to make sense of raw data for better understanding and insight. It is also easier to share with co-workers and stakeholders.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h2>what do we want to achieve?</h2>
        <p>We achieve this by creating solutions that help you:</p>
        <ul class="list2">
            <li>See your data.  It must be easy to see any data necessary, with all the necessary content to make it useful.  An example is financial management accounts after a period was closed. The data could reside in multiple sources, of the same or different format.</li>
            <li>Visualise your data.  It must be quick to see the data in the most understandable format, which may be a graph rather than a table with many rows.</li>
            <li>Get insights from your data.  It must be possible to show the story that the data tells in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>Collaborate.  It must be easy to get and give feedback on relevant data.</li>
            <li>Be more efficient.  It must be possible to be automatically alerted of exceptions, rather than a daily search for them.</li>
        </ul>
